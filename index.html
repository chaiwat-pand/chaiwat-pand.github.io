    <h1>About Chaiwat Pandey - Govind</h1>
    <p style="width: 60ch">Hi there, my name is Chaiwat Pandey. You may call me Govind.
        You're probably here because you're interested in getting to know me. I graduated
        from Kasetsart University with a degree in Mechatronics & Manufacturing engineering.
        After that, I worked as a business analyst at one of Thailand's leading firm in
        tech-consulting.
    </p>

    <p style="width: 60ch">
        Now, I know what you're thinking...WHY LEAVE YOUR JOB!? Well, because I didn't really
        enjoy. After graduation, I wanted to try something new so that's what I did. But after trying,
        I realized I wanted to do something more. As a business analyst, my job was to talk with clients
        and make coordianates with the software developers to make sure that we were able to deliver on
        specific features within a given period of time. After a while, I got bored because it was the same
        thing everyday. I wanted to work in a job where I get to dive-in and get my hands dirty with the
        technical aspects of the work. Luckily, Generation Bootcamp came along and I got the opportunity
        to join it.
    </p>

    <p style="width: 60ch">Oh, you thought there was more to the story!? Nope, at least not now!HAHAHA
        I'll keep updating it as time goes on. So feel free to tune in!
    </p>

    <p style="width: 60ch">As for now, I've created a table down below for you all to get to personally
        know me better!</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Movie Character</h2>
    <p style="width:60ch">Jeez...Where do I begin? There's so many that comes to mind.
        Tom Hardy in Warrior, Christian Bale in American Hustle, Cilian Murphy in
        Peaky Binders <strong><em>(Movie, NOT SERIES!, there's no denying his swag though)</em></strong>,
        and Daniel Day Lewis in There Will be Blood.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 60ch">But I'm feeling good today. So I'll go with Johnny Depp in
        Pirates of the Carribean. I love his work so much that even though 4th and 5th were
        not that good, I still watched plenty of times just to see him play the character.

    <h2>My City - Nonthaburi</h2>
    <p style="width: 60ch;">My City, eh? Well, it's not really mine...I just reside here. Too many jokes?
        Yup, so I've been living in Nothaburi for almost 11 years now. The weather's nice compared to Bangkok.
        Almost all of my close firends live here too. But with COVID-19, it's been harder for us to meet.
        My favorite places in the city are Hattrick Football Stadius cause that's where I play football and my home.
        <strong>Yup, that's it.</strong> I suppose it doesn't do you any good so let me attach a few references below
        so you can know more about the city.

    <h2>My Favorite Product - Campfire Audio Jupiter Earphones</h2>
    <p style="width:60ch">Earphones! Seriously!? Yup, <strong><em>SERIOUSLY!</em></strong>. This baby is very special to
        me.
        It took me a long time to decide which earphone to purchase. I was doing crazy research and trying out a bunch.
        At that point,
        I had never heard of Campfire Audio too. But after visiting Munkong Gadget shop, I tried it out since it was on
        discount. <br>
        <strong>I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE DETAILS THAT I HEARD. MUSIC JUST SOUNDED SO AMAZING!</strong> Eventually, I
        bought them and
        don't have any regrets. For those inteested, I'll attach both Munkong Gadget's website and Campfire Audio
        products on Munkong
        Gadget.
