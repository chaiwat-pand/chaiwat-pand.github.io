        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>My name is Chaiwat Pandey. I graduated from Kasetsart University with a major in Mechatronics and
                Manufacturing Engineering. During my time at the university, I worked as a teaching assistant and was
                also awarded a partial scholarship.</p>
            <p>Upon graduation, I had an opportunity to worked at Accenture as a consulting development analyst. It was
                a great opportunity for me to learn about the tech sector and I had a great time there. My job
                description
                consisted of gathering business requirements and working with software developers to ensure that we were
                able to
                deliver application features by the end of every sprint. Not only that, I would also update the client
                and team members on
                progress and status update.</p>
            <p>At the time, I also enrolled in a Python fundamental programming course and really enjoyed it. I loved it
                so much that I wanted to gain an even better understanding of software development and the fundamentals
                of developing a
                web application so I applied to Generation's Junior Software Developer Bootcamp. Fortunately, I passed
                the screening
                round and got accepted.</p>
            <p>During my time studying in the bootcamp, I learned both soft-skill and hard-skill. To name a few, I
                learned how to create web applications, communicating effectively, and most importantly how to work as a
                team.</p>
